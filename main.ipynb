It has a hierachical structure of the data, i.e., item -> dept -> store -> state.\n","- Working with time-series is interesting as we can harness temporal information (in this case, based on dates).\n","- Date-related features really need to be managed carefully. Here, I would like to highlight the use of cyclical features for dates features such as weekdays and quarters. And what about seasonality?\n","- Categorical features also need to be taken care of by utilizing appropriate encoding, for instance, when to use one-hot encoding (dummy encoding), or when to use label encoding.\n","- We can add more features like mean encoding or different statistical values (such as min, max, and median) in addition to the mentioned features.\n","- Although visualization can be done at different granular levels, I have not done any visualization here due to the time constraint and there are some other notebooks that did a great job in visualizing them. The point is it is a little bit difficult to plot out all the time-series (like 100k time-series in this dataset) to eyeball and find some intuitions. We can do visualizations at the highest levels of aggregration, e.g., store level, or department level.\n","- LightGBM is a de facto model for this kind of job. One of the pros is that it handles categorical features for us (no need to apply label encoding on them).\n","- We can fine tune the model by changing the hyperparameters which could give us chances to get a better performance.\n","- As I mentioned the hierachical structure, we may fuse the results from different granular levels using some kinds of ensemble. An example would be cranking out one model for each store and performing prediction for each store.\n","\n","*Watchanan
